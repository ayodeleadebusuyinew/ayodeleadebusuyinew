# Ayodele Adebusuyi — Cloud / DevOps / SRE

I design and operate secure, automated cloud platforms that scale in production — with strong focus on **Kubernetes (EKS/GKE)**, **Infrastructure as Code**, **CI/CD reliability**, **observability**, and **security/compliance**. I build platforms that reduce operational load, harden security posture, and accelerate delivery without breaking production.

## Platform Capabilities
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure  
- **Kubernetes:** EKS/GKE, Helm, upgrades, scaling, network policies  
- **IaC:** Terraform (reusable modules), CloudFormation, Ansible  
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, quality gates (SonarQube), progressive delivery (canary/blue-green), auto-rollback  
- **Observability:** Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch  
- **Security:** IAM/least privilege, encryption, vuln scanning, DevSecOps guardrails  

## Proof-of-Work (Pinned Repos)
- **Portfolio Site:** [hayourdell-portfolio](https://github.com/Hayourdell/hayourdell-portfolio) — case studies, architecture diagrams, runbooks  
- **EKS Platform IaC:** [terraform-aws-eks-platform](https://github.com/Hayourdell/terraform-aws-eks-platform) — reusable EKS/VPC/IRSA patterns  
- **CI/CD Canary + Auto-Rollback:** [cicd-canary-auto-rollback](https://github.com/Hayourdell/cicd-canary-auto-rollback) — secure delivery with progressive rollout + rollback  
- **Observability + SLO Pack:** [observability-slo-pack](https://github.com/Hayourdell/observability-slo-pack) — dashboards, alerts, SLO examples  
- **DevSecOps Guardrails:** [devsecops-guardrails](https://github.com/Hayourdell/devsecops-guardrails) — IaC scanning, policy gates, vuln workflow  
- **Runbooks & Incident Response:** [runbooks-incident-response](https://github.com/Hayourdell/runbooks-incident-response) — triage playbooks, rollback, postmortems  

## Flagship Case Studies
- **HIPAA-compliant AWS + EKS platform delivery** for healthcare SaaS (security-by-default, auditable delivery, operational readiness)  
- **Enterprise CI/CD standardization + safer Kubernetes releases** (quality gates, rollout safety, reduced failure rate)  
- **Modernization and automation patterns for cloud delivery** (repeatable deployments, reduced manual ops)  

## Operating Principles
- Treat CI/CD and IaC as **products**, not scripts  
- Build **guardrails** so teams can move fast safely  
- Measure reliability with **SLIs/SLOs**, not opinions  
- Prefer **simple, repeatable patterns** over fragile heroics
